Technology is paving the way to modernize our lives and  healthcare is one such domain where technology has enhanced patient convenience and                   engagement.Today’s, healthcare apps are revolutionizing the way medical aid is given in terms of consultations, treatments, and medical prescriptions. But     till now this has mainly focussed only on providing consultancy to patients, helping patients to meet doctors online and medicine delivery, etc. But today    also patients have to go to medical laboratories for various tests prescribed by their doctors and have to wait in queues before their turn comes. This is an issue of more concern in various cases like old age patients, pregnant females, critical  or immovable patients, etc.
